IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTES:

    User's personal folder: %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Growl\2.0.0.0\Displays\
    AllUser's folder: %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Growl\2.0.0.0\Displays\
  (If the same display is found in both locations, the display in the user's personal folder takes precedence.)
